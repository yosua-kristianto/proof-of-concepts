# Smol POC of me learning TensorlayerX

May, 4th 2024.
With the x-times I learned to make some DNN with TensorlayerX, I kind of trying to reassure what is going on within the TensorlayerX. Why can't I ever justify what's going on within the TensorlayerX, even though I'm doing a simple Artificial Neural Network. So here we go, another part of my pilmirage of learning TensorlayerX, begin.

## [May, 4th 2024]()
My goal today is to justify whether I really can do simple ANN with this API.

> What I'm really consider is, there is no "Linear" activation. Only "None" activation. Is it okay?
