# Smol-POC

Welcome to this repository. This repository contains me making something that I've never made before, but I really wanted to use / make it as part of my research.

## Table of Content

### 1. Fsharp - Py Socket

### 2. TensorLayerX 

This folder contains me learn how to make deep learning model using [TensorLayerX](https://tensorlayerx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Since May, I started to dedicated on learning this deep learning API, making sense of things within. Some examples are not done yet, something that I will revisit in the future.
